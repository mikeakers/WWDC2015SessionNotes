What's new in Swift [11:00 AM]
	Fundamentals [11:04 AM]
		Enums [11:04 AM]
			Can now be printed with a useful value
			Associated values of multiple tyepes [11:04 AM]
			Recursive enums are now allowed [11:05 AM]
				indirect keyword
		do statement to create a scope
			old do renamed to "repeat" [11:07 AM]
		Option Sets
			more "set like" [11:08 AM]
			OptionSetType protocol
			#session protocol oriented programming in swift [11:08 AM]
		Functions and methods
			function have now argument labels at call site now [11:09 AM]
			underscore disables argument labels [11:11 AM]
			# argument syntax is gone
	Commpiler
		Better diagnostics and warnings [11:12 AM]
	SDK improvements
		nullability and type of collections can be expressed in Objective-C
		#session swift and objective-C interoperability
		#session whats new in Cocoa
	Unit testing [11:14 AM]
		When testing access control is disabled
		@testable [11:15 AM]
	Rich comments [11:15 AM]
	Migrator
	Readline
		lots more [11:17 AM]
	new swift programming book [11:16 AM]
	Pattern matching [11:17 AM]
		if let where [11:17 AM]
		Guard statement [11:18 AM]
			does check and bails out if the check fails
			can be compounded [11:20 AM]
		Switches
			if case for matching a single case instead of longer switch format
		For in loop [11:21 AM]
			boolean matching and pattern matching in for loop
		other improvements [11:21 AM]
	Availability Checking [11:21 AM]
		respondsToSelector is an error prone pattern [11:23 AM]
		compiler checks availibility based on deployment target [11:24 AM]
		if #available condition added in swift [11:25 AM]
		also works with guard
	#session swift in practice
	Protocol Extensions [11:27 AM]
		can now make extensions on protocols
		for example adding functions to CollectionType
		allows lots of cleanup of standard library [11:29 AM]
		#session protocol oriented programming in Swift
	Error Handling [11:31 AM]
		Kinds of error [11:32 AM]
		Example [11:36 AM]
		#LABQ Functions can't throw? [11:39 AM]
		catch statement has full pattern matching power [11:40 AM]
		fatalError() [11:40 AM]
		try! impossible errors [11:41 AM]
		ErrorType protocol, NSError already conforms to it [11:41 AM]
		Enums as error types [11:42 AM]
			just make the enum conform to ErrorTYpe [11:43 AM]
		#rewatch this section [11:46 AM]
		defer gets called when current scope is left no matter how. [11:47 AM]
		implementation note [11:48 AM]
			swift error handling is more balanced perf wise
			similar in perf to an explicit if statement
		if normal NSError convention is followed, it's converted to a throws func
